I'm still improvising on my presentation skill, but If you follow some tricks, you can make a really good impression.
 Here are my some of my learning, I have learnt while pairing on some of the presentations!

 + **Start presentation with something which will grab audience's attention!**

    Most people when they come to work with us already have some idea of how their speech will go. And the most common mistake people make is starting wrong. They begin with some polite thanks, a little self-introduction, perhaps a shout-out to someone in the audience!

    But you will say what's wrong with this?

    World has changed! Audience will start snoring if you don't start your presentation with something that will wake up their senses! So jump right in, start with an action!

    Use some analogy and link that to your talk or give some case study and your entire talk will revolve around that or may be just start with joke just make audience to laugh! (if you talk is after lunch, you should really think about this :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) or you can quote someone and then start or with funny picture or you can may be start with a question (It may be direct or rhetorical!) or ....!

     Well, [Yahya](https://twitter.com/meetykp)(we were pairing) started with story in [XP-conf](/blog/speaking-at-xp-conf/) and as soon as he finished story, people started clapping and that was an _aha_ moment!:relaxed: It was such an impact!

 + **Judge your audience!**

    Know your audience and what they do! What if majority of audience is from non-technical background, and you start talking too much technical!

    Show off hands always works! Depending on this you might want to take a call, either you can tell audience that it will not help them much and they can attend other talk or you can tweak the content little here and there!

    Review your presentation with other people, that helps to understand audience perspective!

 + **Prepare a lot!**

    >It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare impromptu speech! -- Mark Twain

     Yes, you need to prepare a lot! You need to prepare for gathering presentation content, prepare for delivery of presentation and then mock rehearsals!
     Pairing ease our lot of tasks, like you have always other opinion/view on the content you will be talking and you can come up with really good ideas! But at the same time, you need to rehearse! There are lot of things which you should be careful about, the switching between pairs should be smooth and clean, who will hold clicker, whose turn it will be and many such small ! Do dry runs as many as possible.

 + **Presenter notes**

    I do generally forget important points or just drag one point so much or I go on talking on some different point! :expressionless:

    Writing down actual points you will be talking helps a lot and help you to come on the point for people like me!

+ **Don't be too heavy!**

    This doesn't mean you have to lose your weight! :stuck_out_tongue:

     >If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough! --Albert Einstein

     Well, you need to understand why are you presenting and for whom! If college students, you can't use so much organization jargon, you need to give some examples so that they can relate. Share your experiences, tell some famous stories, and then you are making your job easy!

+ **Shock your audience!**

    Yes, that helps again to grab audience attention and to wake up them :wink:

    There are plethora of ways to shock audience. You can in between end the presentation, may be show some funny slide/video, make them to imagine what if ..!

 + **Don't talk too much!**

    >Presentations aren't about presenter, they're about audience and what audience needs. If the presenter is talking too much it's a sign that he or she has forgotten who's important! -Simon Raybould

    You need to keep in interactive! If you realize that you are talking too much, probably the audience has stopped listening to it!  The simple trick is, if you feel little thirsty / you get feeling that you are talking too much, ask the audience! Look at audience reaction, judge them and ask questions, promote them to tell their stories, or may be tell them share their learning! It's great way where you can keep it interactive, get them engaged and get you most connected with them!

+ **Nervousness**

    Yes, I get lot of nervous before any stage appearance. It can be a dance or a presentation! But it's not at all disaster. In general, people worry too much about nervousness.

    >The audience expects you to be nervous !

    It’s a natural body response that can actually improve your performance: It gives you energy to perform and keeps your mind sharp. Just keep breathing, and you’ll be fine. :relieved:

    On stage you will face some unknowns, your legs might be shivering / your voice is on the verge to break / someone in the audience will start looking at their mobile / someone will be yawning and ...etc! You need to develop stage presence! Keeping eye contact is important!  Find five or six friendly-looking people in different parts of the audience and look them in the eye as you speak.


These are my learning, I'm sure you must have some to share!
